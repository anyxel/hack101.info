## Motive

Cheatsheets are very handy tool. Because it is not possible for us to remember all the commands or functions of a library at once. In that case, if we make a list of such commands or function does such a thing, then very easily when someone wants to work later, they can find everything they need just by looking at that list. We can divide our entire knowledge into different categories and list only the actual functionality very briefly. In which later an ethical hacker/security researcher will find what he wants with just a quick glance.

## How do it Works?

This project is completely GitHub based. This is where all our cheatsheets are organized as **json** files inside a directory called [**data**](https://github.com/anyxel/hack101.info/blob/main/data). Our main application will display the data from here. We currently support two formats of cheatsheets.

- Format with code and description([See demo here](https://github.com/anyxel/hack101.info/blob/main/data/demo/codendesc.json))
- Code Only([See demo here](https://github.com/anyxel/hack101.info/blob/main/datademo/onlycode.json))
- mix ([see demo here](https://github.com/anyxel/hack101.info/blob/main/data/demo/mix.json))

Any new formats will be added in future if needed. If you want [from](https://github.com/anyxel/hack101.info/issues/new) can create an issue to create a new format.
